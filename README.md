## What I Learned

It's amazing how Unreal has all this AI stuff built in with room to make things super complex (unlike Unity's super super implementation of AI). Unreal has sight, memory, hearing, even smelling all built in! Buuuuut, it's also super complex to get something simple to even work.

## Notes

No issues for once!! :D
