## What I Learned

It's amazing how Unreal has all this AI stuff built in with room to make things super complex (unlike Unity's super super implementation of AI). Unreal has sight, memory, hearing, even smelling all built in! Buuuuut, it's also super complex to get something simple to even work. The behavior trees are pretty great, and I really like how you can build your own tasks from scratch in blueprint or C++. It seems like everything in Unreal is editable on every level, unlike Unity where sometimes you just have to "deal with it"

## Notes

No issues for once!! :D
